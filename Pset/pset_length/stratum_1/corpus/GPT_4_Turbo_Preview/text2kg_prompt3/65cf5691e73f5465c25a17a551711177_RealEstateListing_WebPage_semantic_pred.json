        "description[TOK_Q_DELIM]Atlantic Bliss Bald Head Island is a wonderful oceanfront vacation rental house that will have you addicted to beach life. The location is fabulous and could only be better if you were sleeping on the beach. Why rough it when you can have it all – a great home and a private, direct beach access - with views for miles? If you’re not frolicking on the beach, you might be lounging on the screened porch or under the shady deck watching the tide roll in. This home is shining as bright as the sun.

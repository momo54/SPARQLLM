With the increased utilization of 3D cultures for phenotypic screening and toxicity assessment, there is a growing need to optimize assay sensitivity, resolution, and throughput. Here, we explore how high-performance water immersion objectives on the ImageXpressÂ® Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System facilitate these growing demands by enhancing the sensitivity, resolution and throughput for complex 3D structures such as spheroids, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip biology.", "image": "https://www.moleculardevices.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/water-immersion-technology.png", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Tim Baranowski"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Molecular Devices, LLC.", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.moleculardevices.com/themes/moldev/images/moldev-logo.png"}}, "datePublished": "2020-11-20", "url": "https://www.moleculardevices.com/lab-notes/cellular-imaging-systems/water-immersion-technology-and-high-content-imaging", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.moleculardevices.com/lab-notes/cellular-imaging-systems/water-immersion-technology-and-high-content-imaging"}}

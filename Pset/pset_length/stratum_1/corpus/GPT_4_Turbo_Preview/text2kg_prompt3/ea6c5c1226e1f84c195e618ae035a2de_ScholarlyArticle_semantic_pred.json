        "description[TOK_Q_DELIM]The NYU Rudin Center for Transportation and 6t-research office have published the results of a large-scale exploratory survey on the consumption and mobility practices of the population of Paris and Manhattan (NYC). The survey aims at comparing online consumption practices (both for food and non-food related items) of Parisians and New Yorkers (focusing on Manhattan residents), focusing particularly on identifying the profiles of e-consumers, singling out the determinants of online consumption, notably in a context where express and instant delivery are developing rapidly, identifying the characteristics of at-home meal delivery, and estimating the impacts of online consumption practices on mobility practices.[TOK_Q_DELIM]ScholarlyArticle": {

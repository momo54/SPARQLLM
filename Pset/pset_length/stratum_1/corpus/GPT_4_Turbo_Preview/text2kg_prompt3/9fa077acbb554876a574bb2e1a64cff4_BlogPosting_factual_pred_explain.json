        "description[TOK_Q_DELIM]Three-dimensional (3D) cellular assays have emerged as a valuable tool in drug discovery and biological research, as they closely mimic in vivo environments and are shown to generate more physiologically relevant data than many 2D assays. With the increased utilization of 3D cultures for phenotypic screening and toxicity assessment, there is a growing need to optimize assay sensitivity, resolution, and throughput. Here, we explore how high-performance water immersion objectives on the ImageXpress® Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System facilitate these growing demands by enhancing the sensitivity, resolution and throughput for complex 3D structures such as spheroids, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip biology.[TOK_Q_DELIM]BlogPosting": {

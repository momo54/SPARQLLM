        "step[TOK_Q_DELIM]1. Trace your plate and make a roughly 7 inch circle.\n\n2. Measure a line on the radius of the circle (half the width/diameter).\n\n3. Cut off a bit more than half of the circle. It doesn't have to be exact - you'll be able to play with the shape in the next step and make a larger or smaller seam as you'd like.\n\n4. Fold it in half and glue the straight edge together to form a seam. Make sure the cone is in a proportion that you like.\n\n5. When it dries, trim the seam if necessary and turn your hat right side out.\n\n6. Trim around the base.\n\n7. Make your pom pom. Mine was deliberately oversized in proportion to the hat. Tulle is a lightweight material so it can handle it.  I used a different method however I recommend you learn how to make a pom pom with tulle here and use that method.\n\n8. Place some glue on the tip of the cone and attach it to the core of the pom pom.\n\n9. If you'd like to add a tulle border, twist a piece around the base, gluing as you go along. Rustic lace can look fabulous here as well.\n\n10. Trace a circle a tiny bit smaller (like 1mm) than the base of your cone.\n\n11. And glue it to the base of your first birthday hat.\n\n12. Attach an elastic to fit around your baby's head and cover it with a smaller piece of felt to hide the elastic seam. This makes it more comfortable to wear too.[TOK_Q_DELIM]HowTo": {

That means your central nervous system may be producing more or less of your own brain chemicals in an attempt to counteract the drug in your system and achieve balanced brain chemistry.\n\nIf you stop using your drug of choice, your brain chemistry will become unbalanced, like someone jumping off a seesaw. This chemical imbalance is called withdrawal. Your brain and body are missing the chemical they’ve gotten used to.\n\nDetox can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the psychoactive drug you are dependent on. Most, however, will cause powerful withdrawal symptoms that compel you to use again.\n\nFor the most part, drug withdrawal symptoms are extremely uncomfortable but not life-threatening. However, some drugs can cause severe symptoms that can be medically dangerous and even deadly without treatment, particularly drugs in the central nervous system depressant category.\n\nWhether a drug causes uncomfortable or deadly withdrawal symptoms, it may be difficult to get through on your own without relapsing. That’s where medical detox comes in. Detox services are designed to help get you through the withdrawal phase safely and as comfortable as possible.\n\nDetoxification, or detox, as it is commonly shortened to, has two meanings. The first is the textbook definition: the act of clearing the body of addictive, toxic, and harmful substances, like drugs and alcohol, to stop the physical and psychological damage that extended substance abuse causes.\n\nThe other meaning of detox refers to the process itself as it’s carried out by medical detox facilities and other treatment centers. It is a form of addiction treatment that provides medical support, resources, and interventions to help manage acute intoxication and the withdrawal symptoms that follow the stoppage of drug or alcohol use.\n\nThe purpose of alcohol and drug detox is to both ensure these substances are completely removed from someone’s system and that they manage to make it through withdrawal safely and with the least amount of discomfort possible.\n\nMedical detox is administered by doctors and health care professionals who are experienced and well-trained in the field of addiction.\n\nWhile undergoing detox is overall not a pleasant experience, it is still the necessary first step to essentially all forms of recovery from substance use disorders. In fact, many addiction recovery treatment programs begin with medical detox anyway.\n\nSomeone cannot expect to get sober and start their recovery while they still have drugs or alcohol in their systems. They also cannot effectively start the recovery process while dealing with the withdrawal symptoms caused by stopping drug or alcohol use, which can be uncomfortable and distracting at best and potentially life-threatening at worst.\n\nThe above two reasons highlight why detox has to happen before someone can begin an addiction recovery treatment program, some people might be under the mistaken impression that detox is unnecessary, or that they can just stop using alcohol or drugs all at once on their own without any serious consequences.\n\nThis is not the case, though, as the long-term effects of chronic substance use make it challenging for someone to stop using on their own since their body and brain have become dependent. It also means that if and when they do stop using, there are going to be inescapable physical and mental effects.\n\nDepending on the severity of someone’s dependence, the substance they were abusing, and how long they were abusing it for, exact withdrawal symptoms will vary from person to person. Some common mild withdrawal symptoms that almost anyone stopping the use of drugs or alcohol and can expect to experience include:\n\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Confusion\n- Mood swings\n- Irritability\n- Anxiety\n- Depression\n- Fatigue\n- Muscle aches and pains\n- Fever, chills, and other flu-like symptoms\n- Insomnia\n\nHowever, other symptoms, while still very common, are much more severe and hard to manage, including:\n\n- Hallucinations\n- Delirium\n- Psychosis\n- Irregular heartbeat\n- Suicidal thoughts or behaviors\n- Seizures\n- Panic attacks\n- Disassociation\n\nThese symptoms can be much more unpredictable and difficult to manage. If someone attempts to quit using drugs or alcohol that they have become addicted to “cold turkey” rather than go through medical detox, they are extremely likely to experience symptoms like suicidal thoughts and seizures due to the immense shock to the system quitting all at once triggers.\n\nThe body and brain are suddenly deprived of something they have become dependent on and now are struggling to function without it.\n\nWhile some substances will have milder withdrawals, others are known to have withdrawal periods so intense and possibly dangerous that they should always be stopped via a carefully planned detox, including:\n\n- Alcohol\n- Benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium\n- Opioids, either illicit like heroin or prescription like OxyContin\n- Methamphetamines\n- Certain non-benzo sedatives such as Lunesta or Ambien\n\nAttempting to detox on your own creates a lot of unnecessary risks. Do so also means leaving yourself open to the consequences of some of the symptoms outlined above, such as seizures or delirium tremens.\n\nIt also is much less likely to be successful, as many people find the symptoms of withdrawal associated with drug and alcohol detox too much to handle and will often relapse mid-detox. This also raises the risk of accidentally overdosing, which frequently occurs when someone relapses and takes a much larger dose of a substance than they usually would to try and get relief from extreme withdrawal symptoms.\n\nChoosing medical detoxification at a professional rehab or detox center removes these potential problems by having a dedicated staff available to administer medications that can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal and make them more manageable. Through medical maintenance therapy, the withdrawal process can be made much more achievable, with the minimum amount of pain or discomfort.\n\nIf someone chooses an inpatient medical detox specifically, it also eliminates the possibility of a mid-detox relapse, as they will be removed from their environment and placed under 24-7 monitoring.\n\nUndergoing medical detox at a professional treatment center also means that a doctor can start a tapering schedule to slowly wean people off the substance they have become dependent on. Instead of trying to quit cold turkey and enduring the stress this puts on the body, tapering instead carefully lowers the dosage over time until it is safe to stop using drugs or alcohol without the danger of triggering a seizure or other medical complications.\n\nWhile it is understandable to feel frustrated by tapering’s lengthier detox process, it is the safest and most effective way to do a drug and alcohol detox. Some opt instead for a method known as “rapid detox.” This involves being placed under general anesthetic and given medications intravenously to speed up the detox process from days or weeks to as little as four to six hours.\n\nHowever, rapid detox is expensive, typically not covered by insurance, and often risky. Numerous studies have questioned the actual effectiveness of rapid detox and documented heart attacks, seizures, and other severe complications, many of which have been fatal.\n\nTraditional medical detox may take longer, but it is the best way to ensure a safe, successful detoxification without any unnecessary discomfort that leaves people ready to continue on to the next phase of treatment.", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Maryland House Detox"}, "datePublished": "2022-03-01", "url": "https://mhdetox.com/drug-and-alcohol-detox/"}

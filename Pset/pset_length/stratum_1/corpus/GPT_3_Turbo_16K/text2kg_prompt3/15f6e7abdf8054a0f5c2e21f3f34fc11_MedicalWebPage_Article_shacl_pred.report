                    schema1:articleBody """When you become chemically dependent on a psychoactive drug, your brain has adapted to the drug by altering your natural neurochemistry. That means your central nervous system may be producing more or less of your own brain chemicals in an attempt to counteract the drug in your system and achieve balanced brain chemistry.

If you stop using your drug of choice, your brain chemistry will become unbalanced, like someone jumping off a seesaw. This chemical imbalance is called withdrawal. Your brain and body are missing the chemical they’ve gotten used to.

Detox can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the psychoactive drug you are dependent on. Most, however, will cause powerful withdrawal symptoms that compel you to use again.

For the most part, drug withdrawal symptoms are extremely uncomfortable but not life-threatening. However, some drugs can cause severe symptoms that can be medically dangerous and even deadly without treatment, particularly drugs in the central nervous system depressant category.

Whether a drug causes uncomfortable or deadly withdrawal symptoms, it may be difficult to get through on your own without relapsing. That’s where medical detox comes in. Detox services are designed to help get you through the withdrawal phase safely and as comfortable as possible.

Detoxification, or detox, as it is commonly shortened to, has two meanings. The first is the textbook definition: the act of clearing the body of addictive, toxic, and harmful substances, like drugs and alcohol, to stop the physical and psychological damage that extended substance abuse causes. The other meaning of detox refers to the process itself as it’s carried out by medical detox facilities and other treatment centers. It is a form of addiction treatment that provides medical support, resources, and interventions to help manage acute intoxication and the withdrawal symptoms that follow the stoppage of drug or alcohol use.

The purpose of alcohol and drug detox is to both ensure these substances are completely removed from someone’s system and that they manage to make it through withdrawal safely and with the least amount of discomfort possible.

Medical detox is administered by doctors and health care professionals who are experienced and well-trained in the field of addiction.

While undergoing detox is overall not a pleasant experience, it is still the necessary first step to essentially all forms of recovery from substance use disorders. In fact, many addiction recovery treatment programs begin with medical detox anyway.

Someone cannot expect to get sober and start their recovery while they still have drugs or alcohol in their systems. They also cannot effectively start the recovery process while dealing with the withdrawal symptoms caused by stopping drug or alcohol use, which can be uncomfortable and distracting at best and potentially life-threatening at worst.""" ;

That means your central nervous system may be producing more or less of your own brain chemicals in an attempt to counteract the drug in your system and achieve balanced brain chemistry.

If you stop using your drug of choice, your brain chemistry will become unbalanced, like someone jumping off a seesaw. This chemical imbalance is called withdrawal. Your brain and body are missing the chemical they’ve gotten used to.

Detox can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the psychoactive drug you are dependent on. Most, however, will cause powerful withdrawal symptoms that compel you to use again.

For the most part, drug withdrawal symptoms are extremely uncomfortable but not life-threatening. However, some drugs can cause severe symptoms that can be medically dangerous and even deadly without treatment, particularly drugs in the central nervous system depressant category.

Whether a drug causes uncomfortable or deadly withdrawal symptoms, it may be difficult to get through on your own without relapsing. That’s where medical detox comes in. Detox services are designed to help get you through the withdrawal phase safely and as comfortable as possible.

Detoxification, or detox, as it is commonly shortened to, has two meanings. The first is the textbook definition: the act of clearing the body of addictive, toxic, and harmful substances, like drugs and alcohol, to stop the physical and psychological damage that extended substance abuse causes. The other meaning of detox refers to the process itself as it’s carried out by medical detox facilities and other treatment centers. It is a form of addiction treatment that provides medical support, resources, and interventions to help manage acute intoxication and the withdrawal symptoms that follow the stoppage of drug or alcohol use.

The purpose of alcohol and drug detox is to both ensure these substances are completely removed from someone’s system and that they manage to make it through withdrawal safely and with the least amount of discomfort possible.

Medical detox is administered by doctors and health care professionals who are experienced and well-trained in the field of addiction.

While undergoing detox is overall not a pleasant experience, it is still the necessary first step to essentially all forms of recovery from substance use disorders. In fact, many addiction recovery treatment programs begin with medical detox anyway.

Someone cannot expect to get sober and start their recovery while they still have drugs or alcohol in their systems.

As Holi is primarily a North Indian festival, it's quite subdued at most places in the south. The focus is mainly on religious aspects and temple rites. However, Hampi in Karnataka is a notable exception! The whole town turns out to play Holi in the morning (perhaps for the benefit of the many western travelers there), amid drumming, dancing, and the evocative ruins of the grand Vijayanagar empire. Afterwards, the crowd slowly moves to the river to wash all the color off."}

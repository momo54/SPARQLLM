        "recipeInstructions[TOK_Q_DELIM]Pick up some pork shoulder steaks. As I mentioned above, these steaks came from my brother's farm, which is a good place to get them. Unfortunately, small local farmers are in short supply and so you will be faced with purchasing your pork shoulder steaks from a grocery store. At the store, you may have to make a choice between regular and organic. Ask yourself not just 'why is organic so expensive?' but also 'why is the other stuff so cheap?'\n\nSeason the pork shoulder steaks. Even with a cheaper cut of meat like shoulder steaks it may still not be necessary to season them with anything more than salt and pepper. But that doesn't mean you can't have some fun with it. For example, today I am using curry salt to season my pork shoulder steaks. It was something my roommate picked up at a fancy food store. There a few varieties of pepper out there too, but I still like fresh cracked black pepper.\n\nPan fry the first side of the pork shoulder steaks. Heat up a frying pan over medium-high heat. Put a little vegetable oil or butter in the bottom of the pan. Once the pan is hot, lay the pork shoulder steaks into the frying pan. As the first side of the steak cooks, there may be some smoke or splattering grease. This is a pretty common result of the application of heat to an item. Turn on a vent or something. Check the underside of the steak after 3 or 4 minutes to see how it's doing.\n\nPan fry the second side of the pork shoulder steaks. Once the first side is adequately browned . . . in all honesty, I should have browned mine more, looking at the picture to the right. So, once your first side is a little darker than the picture to the right, flip them and do the other side. After that's done, check the internal temperature with a digital thermometer. It should read around 145 degrees F or so. Once they're done, remove them to a plate and make some pan sauce or just fry some onions to put on them.[TOK_Q_DELIM]Recipe": {

        "description[TOK_Q_DELIM]Pork shoulder steaks come in a couple of varieties. There are shoulder arm steaks and shoulder blade steaks. I believe these are shoulder blade steaks, or close to it. These steaks were simply labeled 'shoulder steaks,' so who really knows. The pig came from my brother's farm in Pipestone, MN. It was free-range, happy, healthy, and well cared for, which is how I want my meat to be raised. Don't you?[TOK_Q_DELIM]Recipe": {

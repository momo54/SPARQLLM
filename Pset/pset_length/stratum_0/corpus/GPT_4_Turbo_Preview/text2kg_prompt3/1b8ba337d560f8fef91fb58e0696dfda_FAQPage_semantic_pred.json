        "text[TOK_Q_DELIM]The Medical—Vocational Rules, also known as grid rules, are guidelines used by the Social Security Administration to ensure consistency in decision-making regarding disability claims. These rules take into account a person's age, education, work experience, and physical or mental conditions to determine their ability to adjust to other work. The premise is that as a person ages, their ability to transition into new occupations diminishes, making it more likely for older individuals to be considered disabled if they cannot perform their previous work or any other work considering their limitations.[TOK_Q_DELIM]Answer": {

        "text[TOK_Q_DELIM]For individuals over 50, the grid rules acknowledge that it's harder to adapt to new occupations due to age-related limitations. For instance, a person who has performed light work for the past fifteen years and is now limited to seated work is considered disabled at age 50, provided they don't have skills that transfer to seated jobs. At age 55, the rules further relax, considering individuals who have done medium exertional work but are now limited to light work as disabled, even if they might physically perform other lighter exertion jobs. This illustrates the importance of age in disability determination under the grid rules.[TOK_Q_DELIM]Answer": {

        },
        "text[TOK_Q_DELIM]A person's age is crucial in determining disability due to the Medical—Vocational Rules, or grid rules, which suggest that occupational mobility decreases with age. These rules are used after it's established that an individual cannot perform past relevant work, helping to identify alternative occupations they might be able to perform. For example, someone who has done light work for the past fifteen years and now can only perform seated jobs is considered disabled at age 50, assuming no transferable skills to seated jobs. The rules become more liberal at age 55, considering individuals who have performed medium exertional level work but are now limited to light exertion as disabled.[TOK_Q_DELIM]Answer": {

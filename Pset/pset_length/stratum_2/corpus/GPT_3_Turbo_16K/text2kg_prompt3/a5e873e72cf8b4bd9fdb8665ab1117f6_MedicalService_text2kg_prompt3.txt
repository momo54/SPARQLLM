## Car Crash Injuries Treated at South Shore ER

Over 38,000 Americans die in car crashes every year, and more than four
million people are [injured in an auto accident](about:blank) annually. Those
are the reported numbers – but many more people who are injured fail to seek
treatment until underlying problems appear days, weeks, or months after a
motor vehicle accident.

Many car accident injuries we treat at our emergency room are immediately
evident, but that’s not always the case.

For instance, **delayed back pain** after an automobile accident or the later
appearance of whiplash symptoms are often not linked to the crash.

 **South Shore ER** sometimes gets calls from car crash injury victims who
ask, “How long do you have to see a doctor after an auto accident?”

![A woman with neck pain following a motor vehicle
accident.](https://southshoreer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neck-pain-auto-
accident-emergency-care.jpg)

The medical answer is that you should see an **auto accident doctor** as
quickly as possible to get checked for injuries, whether you think you were
hurt in the accident or not.

 **Don’t risk missing** the [symptoms of whiplash](about:blank) **.** Remember
that it may be weeks after the car accident that back pain, neck pain, or
other medical problems from an MVA (motor vehicle accident) can first appear.
Get a motor vehicle accident injury evaluation right away.

## A Special Note About Whiplash Injury

Many of the car accident patients we treat have received a “[whiplash
injury](about:blank).” Whiplash (also called “neck sprain” or “neck strain”)
is caused by the sudden, forceful movement of the head in either direction
during a car crash.

 **Symptoms of whiplash** sometimes aren’t evident immediately, but can later
cause excruciating neck pain, headaches, low back pain, difficulty
concentrating, shoulder pain, and other serious consequences.

 **Don’t wait to get examined following an automobile accident**.

The physicians and staff at **South Shore ER** are specially trained to
diagnose car accident injuries you may not yet realize you have.

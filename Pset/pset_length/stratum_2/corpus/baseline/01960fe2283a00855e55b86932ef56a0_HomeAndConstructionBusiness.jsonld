    "description": "When it’s time to resurface, there are more options now than there have ever been. Plaster was once the standard material, then fiberglass became the option of choice, BUT now there’s a better option that’s gaining traction: Glasscoat. Plaster pools are hard to resurface—the repairs are hard to get right, and can sometimes peel away within a relatively short time. Even the color of the pool resurfacing material can wind up different, making your pool look mottled or blotchy.",
